# FizzBuzz - An example of the 'FizzBuzz' programming exercise

app.js is an example of a script which prints the numbers from 1 to 100, however it will print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5

An adapted example of this script can be found here: https://codepen.io/Steve-H/pen/BaZKVWN where the script will display results in the DOM to check the output.
